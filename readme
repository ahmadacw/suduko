teminal based sudoku game.
supports the following commands:-
  1.  solve [X]:-
         Starts a puzzle in Solve mode, loaded from a file with the name "X", where X
         Includes a full or relative path to the file.
  2.  edit [X]:-
         Starts a puzzle in Edit mode, loaded from a file with the name "X", where X
         Includes a full or relative path to the file, if no X is supplied then the 
         Program will start an empty 9X9 puzzle.
  3.  mark_errors [X]:-
         Sets the "mark errors" setting to X, when X=1 the program displays your errors.
         When X=0 the program doesn't.
  4.  print_board:-
         Prints the board to the terminal.
  5.  set [X][Y][Z]:-
         Sets the values of cell <X,Y> to Z (X is the column, Y is the row).
  6.  validate:-
          Validate the current board using ILP, ensuring that it is solvable or not.
  7.  guess [X]:-
          Guesses a solution to the current board using LP with threshold X, X is used as the
          Minimum probability for a cell to be set to a certain value.
  8.  generate [X][Y]:-
          Generates a puzzle by randomly filling X empty cells with legal values,
          running ILP to solve the board, and then clearing all but Y random cell.
  9.  undo :-
          Undo a previous move done by the user
  10. redo :-
          Redo a move previously undone by the user.
  11. save [X]:-
          Saves the current game board to the specified file, where X includes a full or
          Relative path to the file.
  12. hint [X][Y]:-
          Give a hint to the user by showing the solution of a single cell X,Y.
  13. guess_hint [X][Y]:-
          Show a guess to the user for the cell X Y, the guess is done by using LP.
  14. num_solutions:-
          Print the number of solutions for the current board, we do that by running 
          an extensive backtracking algorithm to find all possible solutions.
  15. autofill:-
          automatically fill "obvious" values - cells which can only have a single possible legal value.
  16. reset:-
          undo all moves, reverting the board to its original loaded state.
  17. exit:-
          terminate the program.
